tools: [Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib]

description: The notebook analyzes financial data, focusing on the normality of stock returns. It imports necessary libraries and data, preprocesses it, and creates dollar, volume, and tick bars. The normality of stock returns is tested using the Jarque-Bera test, which checks for skewness and kurtosis. Additionally, the distributions of returns are plotted and compared to a normal distribution. Testing for normality is crucial because many financial models assume normal distribution of returns, which impacts risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and pricing of financial instruments. Understanding deviations from normality helps in making more accurate financial decisions.
