description: This notebook focuses on clustering DeFi pools using k-means clustering. It includes data collection and processing from the DeFi Llama API, data exploration, and transformation to create new variables such as rolling averages and standard deviations. The notebook visualizes the data using scatter plots and histograms, determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method, and performs k-means clustering. The results are visualized, and a pivot table summarizes the mean values for each variable grouped by cluster. The notebook also includes code for saving visualizations and viewing the number of pools in each cluster.
