description: This script is a comprehensive workflow for a machine learning project in finance. The script then imports and preprocesses financial data. The script visualizes price data over time and computes daily volatility. It applies a symmetric CUSUM filter to detect significant events and generates labels using the triple-barrier method. A moving average strategy is developed, and labels are created based on the strategy. A Random Forest classifier is trained on the training data, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
