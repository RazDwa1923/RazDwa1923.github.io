description: This Jupyter Notebook visualizes trends in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) space by generating various charts to analyze Total Value Locked (TVL), the number of projects, pools, and liquid staking pools across different blockchains. It imports necessary libraries, processes the data from a CSV file, and creates multiple visualizations, including bar charts for TVL over time, TVL by the largest chains, and percentage changes in TVL. Additionally, it analyzes the number of projects and pools over time and by chain, and visualizes liquid staking pools' TVL and their changes.
