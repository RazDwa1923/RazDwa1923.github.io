description: Built ML algorithm to predict the yield of DeFi pools. The algorithm uses historical data of crypto prices, DeFi TVL and yields. Algorithms used included Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Random Forest produced the best results and analysis includes a look at the feature importance of the model parameters.
