  description: "My work in data science focuses on automating investment decision-making across both digital assets and traditional finance. I developed a Python-based algorithm that benchmarks DeFi yields, ranks top-performing opportunities, and forecasts future yields with 90% accuracy. This tool integrates advanced statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, including logistic and linear regression, Decision Tree classifiers, and Random Forest models, to provide a data-driven edge in yield prediction. My key strengths lie in: 1) Financial Data Transformation – Leveraging my statistics background to prepare and structure financial data for machine learning applications. 2) Technology Selection – Identifying and applying the right tools in a rapidly evolving tech landscape to achieve the most effective results. By combining quantitative expertise with strategic insight, I specialize in building intelligent systems that enhance financial decision-making."
