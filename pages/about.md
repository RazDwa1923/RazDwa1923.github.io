# **About Me**

Hi I am **Karol** :wave:,<br>

I am a Data Scientist specializing in Machine Learning with Financial Data, covering both traditional and digital asset markets.  

My journey into programming and advanced analytics has been unconventional. With over a decade of experience in corporate strategy and finance, I have collaborated with some of the world's largest companies to make critical financial and business decisions.  

Driven by curiosity and a desire to work smarter and more efficiently, I discovered coding and began developing my own algorithms, models, and data applications.  

My current specialty is applying advanced analytics to financial problems. Given the statistical limitations of financial data, many machine learning models cannot be used out of the box. I excel in exploring data and making the necessary adjustments to time series data to ensure it can be utilized with the latest machine learning and deep learning techniques.  

In addition to my professional experience, I hold an undergraduate degree in Economics and Finance from the University of Toronto and a master's degree in Finance and Business from ESADE Business School in Spain. I'm also a certified Data Scientist with DataCamp.
